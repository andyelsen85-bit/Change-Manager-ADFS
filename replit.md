# IT Change Management

Production-ready, ITIL v4-aligned IT Change Management web app.

## Overview

A pnpm workspace monorepo (TypeScript) that ships:

- `artifacts/api-server` — Express 5 API (auth, RBAC, change requests, phases, approvals, CAB, comments, dashboard, settings, audit).
- `artifacts/change-mgmt` — React + Vite web frontend (TanStack Query, wouter, shadcn/ui, Tailwind v4, light/dark theme).
- `lib/db` — Drizzle ORM schema + migrations (PostgreSQL).
- `lib/api-spec` / `lib/api-zod` — OpenAPI spec and generated Zod schemas / React Query hooks.
- `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` + `docker/` — self-host bundle (Nginx + Node + Postgres) listening on 80/443 with auto self-signed TLS.

## Feature highlights

- **Change tracks**: Normal, Standard, Emergency. Each has Planning + Testing + PIR phases.
- **Standard templates**: 15 seeded templates that auto-approve and bypass CAB.
- **Approvals**: role-based per track — Normal needs only Change Manager (post-CAB sign-off); Emergency needs Change Manager + eCAB member; Standard auto-approves. The Change Manager's deputy can vote in their absence.
- **Roles**: Change Manager, Technical Reviewer, Business Owner, **CAB Member**, eCAB Member, Implementer, Tester, Service Owner, Security Reviewer. Every role supports a deputy.
- **CAB / eCAB**: calendar of meetings, attendee management, ICS invite download (members add it to their calendar themselves), and a "Send agenda" action that emails every member the full agenda — meeting metadata plus, for every change on the docket, its ref/title, track, status, risk, impact, planned start/end, and full description — so members can review before the meeting starts. The "New meeting" dialog defaults the attendee list to all primary CAB Members for a standard CAB and to all primary eCAB Members for an eCAB; switching the meeting kind reapplies the corresponding default. Backed by `GET /api/users?role=<key>&primary=1` (filters to non-deputy assignments) and `POST /api/cab-meetings/:id/send-agenda`.
- **Change progress timeline**: the Change detail page shows a per-track horizontal timeline (green ✓ for completed steps, highlighted current step, muted future steps; cancelled / rejected / rolled-back rendered as a red stop-tile) so it's obvious at a glance where the change is in its lifecycle.
- **Deputies / replacements** for every governance role (incl. Change Manager) so approvals never block.
- **Notifications**: per-user granular email preferences keyed by event, with an
  account-wide admin master-switch (`users.notifications_enabled`) that
  short-circuits all delivery for a user when off. In-app notifications were
  removed in backup format v2; PUT routes still accept and discard `inApp`
  for backwards compatibility with v1 backup payloads.
  Per-change assignees (Tech Reviewer / Implementer / Tester) override the
  global role pool when routing approval + status emails — the role pool is
  used as a fallback when no per-change override exists. Events added in v2:
  `change.submitted`, `change.scheduled`, `change.completed`,
  `change.assignee_changed`.
- **Categories**: `change_categories` is a small admin-managed lookup table
  feeding the Category dropdown on every change form. Managed under
  Settings → Categories. Deleting an in-use category soft-deactivates.
- **Pre-prod testing (Normal track)**: optional `in_preprod_testing` status
  inserted between `approved` and `scheduled` when a change is created with
  `hasPreprodEnv=true`. Timeline tile is hidden on changes that don't
  require it.
- **Meeting-gated approvals (Normal track)**: CAB approvals can only be cast
  while the parent meeting is `in_progress` (started via Process Meeting) or
  `completed`. CabDetail page exposes Process / Complete buttons and an
  embedded per-change approval panel.
- **CA-cert anchors**: SMTP and LDAP both accept an optional PEM CA chain
  appended to Node's trust store at runtime; SMTP additionally has a
  `tlsRejectUnauthorized` toggle for legacy relays.
- **Auth**: local users (bcrypt) + LDAP. JWT cookie session (`cm_session`). CSRF protection via double-submit cookie (`cm_csrf` non-HttpOnly cookie + `X-CSRF-Token` header) — required on every POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE under `/api` except `/api/auth/login`. Token issued on login, cleared on logout, healed by `/api/auth/me`. The frontend `api` client in `artifacts/change-mgmt/src/lib/api.ts` reads the cookie and attaches the header automatically.
- **Settings (admin)**: SMTP, LDAP, SSL/TLS upload + in-app CSR generation (POST /api/settings/ssl/csr — RSA 2048/3072/4096, DNS+IP SANs, key usage / extKeyUsage server-auth, private key persisted server-side until the signed cert is uploaded), session/lockout timeouts. Sensitive values returned as `*Set` booleans on GET.
- **LDAP diagnostics**: `authenticateLdap` and `POST /api/settings/ldap/test` return a structured `{ success, stage, message, code?, details?, userDn? }` (`LdapTestResult`). `stage` is one of `config | connect | service-bind | search | user-bind | ok` so admins can tell exactly where a failed bind broke. The Settings → LDAP panel renders this as a persistent diagnostic card and includes one-click presets: **OpenLDAP** `(uid={{username}})`, **Active Directory (sAMAccountName)** `(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName={{username}}))`, and **Active Directory (UPN)** `(&(objectClass=user)(userPrincipalName={{username}}))`. Server-side, every stage is logged via pino with `{ url, baseDn, usernameMasked, stage, code }` (the username is reduced to a fingerprint, never the password) so the host operator can correlate UI test results with `docker compose logs api`. The panel also exposes a **Verify TLS certificate** toggle (`tlsRejectUnauthorized` column on `ldap_settings`) — defaults ON; OFF lets the bind succeed against self-signed certs, internal CAs Node doesn't trust, or hostname mismatches (e.g. connecting by IP). Honoured for both `ldaps://` (URL-driven TLS) and `ldap://` + StartTLS via `tlsOptions.rejectUnauthorized` in `lib/ldap.ts`.
- **Revert action**: Change Manager / Admin can walk a change BACK to an earlier status via `POST /api/changes/:id/revert` (body `{ toStatus, reason }`, reason ≥ 5 chars, audit action `change.reverted`). Reverse-transition graph lives in `lib/state-machine.ts` (`listAllowedReversions`, `isReversionAllowed`); `rolled_back` is the only truly terminal status. Side-effects: reverting back past `awaiting_approval` resets every approval row to `pending`; reverting back across `in_progress`/`implemented` clears `actualStart`/`actualEnd`. The Change detail page surfaces a **Revert…** button + dialog (target-status select + required reason textarea) only for users with `change_manager` role or `isAdmin`. The changes list defaults to a new **All active** filter (`status=active`) that excludes `cancelled`, `completed`, `rejected`, `rolled_back` so operators see their working queue first.
- **Closure notes**: cancelling or rejecting a change requires a reason (min 5 chars, dialog in the UI; rejection votes reuse their mandatory comment). Stored in `change_requests.closure_note`, shown as a red card on the change detail page, and written into the SD+ resolution field (`sdpSyncTerminalState` now also fires on `cancelled`). Cleared when the change is reverted/reopened.
- **Change visibility**: org-wide by design — every authenticated user can READ every change (list, detail, subresources) via the `"authenticated"` fallback in `getChangeViewAccess`. Writes stay gated by `getChangeAccess`. Pentests keep their own strict need-to-know permissions.
- **Dashboard "My tasks"**: pending-approval tasks only surface while the change is actually in `awaiting_approval` (approval rows exist from draft time and sibling rows stay pending after a rejection — neither counts as a task). Change managers/admins also get "review" tasks for every change in `submitted`/`in_review`. Per-change assignees (change_assignees) get tasks too: implementers for approved/in_preprod_testing/scheduled/awaiting_implementation/in_progress, testers for implemented/in_testing while the test record is still pending.
- **Audit log**: immutable JSONB before/after snapshots, including login/logout with IP and user agent. Admin-only; CSV export.
- **Backup & Restore (admin)**: Settings → Backup & Restore tab. `GET /api/backup` streams every table as a single JSON file (read inside one `REPEATABLE READ READ ONLY` transaction so the snapshot is consistent across tables). `POST /api/backup/restore` (200 MB body limit) wipes and re-imports the full database in one transaction with FK-safe ordering, temporarily disables the `audit_log` immutability triggers, then resets every serial/identity sequence discovered via `pg_catalog`. Both endpoints are admin-only AND require `Origin == Host` (defence-in-depth against credentialed cross-origin reads given the global permissive CORS). UI requires the user to type "RESTORE" before the destructive action and reloads on success. Lives in `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/backup.ts` + `routes/backup.ts` + `BackupPanel` in `Settings.tsx`.

## Workspace layout

```
artifacts/
  api-server/      # Express API (port 8080)
  change-mgmt/     # Vite frontend (port 5000 in dev)
  mockup-sandbox/  # Replit canvas helper (port 8081)
lib/
  db/              # Drizzle schemas + migrations
  api-spec/        # OpenAPI single source of truth
  api-zod/         # Generated Zod schemas / React Query hooks
docker/            # Nginx config + entrypoint for the web container
```

## First-time setup

There is no default admin password. On first boot the API seeds an `admin`
local user with **no password**, and the web app shows a one-time setup
wizard at `/setup` where the operator picks the password. The wizard
auto-logs them in and disappears for good once setup is done.

For an unattended deployment, set `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (>= 8 chars) in
the API container's environment before the first boot. The seed will
create the admin with that password and skip the wizard.

### Recovering a locked-out install

If an existing deployment was bootstrapped by an older version of this
codebase and the admin password is unknown, set
`RESET_ADMIN_PASSWORD=1` in the API container's environment and restart
the API. The next boot will clear the admin's password and re-enable the
`/setup` wizard. **Remove the variable after you complete setup** — the
seed will keep clearing the password on every restart while the variable
is set.

## Key commands

- `pnpm run typecheck` — typecheck all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks + Zod schemas from OpenAPI
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema (dev)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run API locally (port 8080)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/change-mgmt run dev` — run web frontend locally (port 5000)

## Self-hosting with Docker (80 / 443)

After cloning the repo, the simplest path is just:

```
docker compose up -d --build
```

This works without any pre-bootstrap. The compose file ships with a safe
internal-only default for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (the `db` service has no
exposed port — it is only reachable from inside the docker network) and
the api container's entrypoint auto-generates a strong `JWT_SECRET` on
first boot, persisting it to the `api_secrets` named volume so existing
sessions survive `docker compose down`/`up` cycles.

To override either value (recommended for production), create a `.env`
at the repo root and set them explicitly:

```
./scripts/init-env.sh        # generates .env with strong random secrets
# …or copy .env.example to .env and edit by hand, e.g.
#   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 24)
#   JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 64)
docker compose up -d --build
```

Wrapper for the lazy: `./scripts/up.sh` runs `init-env.sh` (if no `.env`)
then `docker compose up -d --build` and tails the logs.

The compose stack runs Postgres, applies migrations, starts the Node API, and an Nginx
container that serves the static frontend on `:80`/`:443` and reverse-proxies `/api/*`
to the API. On first boot the web container generates a self-signed cert at
`./certs/server.{crt,key}` if none exists; drop your real cert in there to override
(no rebuild needed). TLS can also be disabled with `DISABLE_TLS=true` in `.env`.

## Development on Replit

The Replit dev environment runs three workflows:

- `artifacts/api-server: API Server` — Express on `:8080` (proxied to `/api`)
- `artifacts/change-mgmt: web` — Vite on `:5000` (proxied to `/`)
- `artifacts/mockup-sandbox: Component Preview Server` — Vite on `:8081`

> Note: Vite reads stdin and exits on EOF, which makes it look like the workflow
> "didn't open a port". The change-mgmt `dev` script wraps Vite as
> `tail -f /dev/null | vite dev` so stdin stays open under the workflow runner.

See the `pnpm-workspace` skill for monorepo conventions.
